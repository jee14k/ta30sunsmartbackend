## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```

```{r}
data_dir <- "C:/Users/Jeevan/OneDrive - Monash University/Master of Data Science/Semester 4/FIT5120 - Industry experience Studio Project/Onboarding Project/ta30sunsmartbackend/datafiles"

city_names <- c("adelaide","alice-springs","brisbane","canberra","darwin","emerald","gold-coast","kingston","melbourne","newcastle","perth","sydney","townsville")

# Get all UV dataset files
uv_files <- list.files(data_dir, pattern = "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)

# Loop through each city and combine data from all years
for (city in city_names) {
  city_files <- uv_files[grepl(paste0("uv-", city, "-"), uv_files)]  # Match city files
  
  if (length(city_files) > 0) {
    # Read and combine data
    city_data <- lapply(city_files, read_csv) %>% bind_rows()
    
    # Save the combined dataset
    output_file <- file.path(data_dir, paste0("uv-", city, "-combined.csv"))
    write_csv(city_data, output_file)
    
    print(paste("Saved:", output_file))
  } else {
    print(paste("No files found for:", city))
  }
}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
